        </div>

        <p class="blog-detail__italic">
          f creating a solid stream of passive income is your goal for the next 12 months, a trade copier for MetaTrader
          may be the most suitable option. Low learning curve, an easy-to-understand business model, proven profit
          -making system – these are just a few benefits of it. Now, who can make money with the Forex Copy Trading
          Software for MetaTrader (MT4, MT5)? Since there are 3 different ways to get profit from it, there are options
          for new investors, experience traders and entrepreneurs. We will take a closer look at each of them later in
          the article, but for now, let’s start with the basics.
        </p>

        <ul class="blog-detail__rows">
          <li class="blog-detail__row">
            <h3 class="blog-detail__row-label">What is trade copier for MetaTrader4 or MetaTrader5?</h3>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">Firstly, MT4 stands for MetaTrader 4, the world’s most popular trading
              terminal. This means there is no real difference between a trade copier for MT4 and a Metatrader 4 trade
              copier – both are the names of the same service. Automated trade copier is a tool that allows users to
              copy trades of experienced investors. Instead of giving theoretic advice, investors keep trading on their
              own accounts as they normally would. Every time an investor opens up a trade the same signal is sent to
              connected followers accounts. Investors get paid for sharing their strategy either by brokers and service
              providers or by end users.</p>

            <p class="blog-detail__text">There are different trade copier services for MetaTrader 4 available online. As
              you are going to make money with it, it is important to select a well-recognised and reliable one (some of
              them are free!). By the way, copy trading is extremely popular. Even if you are not into using it
              yourself, consider making it a business. Some trade copiers offer white label platforms for partners.
              Through signing up for one, you can create your own copy trading (also known social trading) business
              without handling the backend operations.</p>
          </li>

          <li class="blog-detail__row">
            <h3 class="blog-detail__row-label">Trade Copier for Investors</h3>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">The easiest way to make money with trade copier for MetaTrader 4 is through
              actually using it. On platforms such as MyDigiTrade, investors can sign up for free and are not required
              to make a deposit. The system either connects to your existing trading account or guides you through the
              process of creating a new one. The interface is very user-friendly and easy to learn. All the information
              about trade copying providers is fully transparent. For someone who is busy with his job, but still wants
              to become an investor, this is a perfect place to start. You open an account, select strategy providers
              whose trades you would like to copy, and receive the same profit as they do.</p>
          </li>

          <li class="blog-detail__row">
            <h3 class="blog-detail__row-label">Trade Copier for Traders</h3>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">Any experienced trader, who knows how to trade profitably, can join the
              platform to provide his trading signals. Some trade copying services don’t have prerequisites and accept
              anyone, other, including mentioned above MyDigiTrade, have strict requirements their strategy providers
              must meet. But in general, if a trader can make money for himself, he can also profit from making money
              from others. If a trader is losing the money, no one would follow his signals. That’s why you normally
              won’t find weak performing strategies offered by the copy trader. As an idea for someone who doesn’t trade
              but has a friend who is very experienced in it, consider teaming up with this person. Your role in this
              case would be to create a signal provider profile and attract new followers to his account. Then, you two
              can share the profit.</p>
          </li>

          <li class="blog-detail__row">
            <h3 class="blog-detail__row-label">Trade Copier as a business</h3>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">Now we are down to the most unusual, smart and interesting way to make money
              with the professional trade copier as a service. Instead of joining a platform created by others, you can
              open your own automated trade copier service. It may sound overwhelming, but in reality, it is a lot
              simpler and more affordable than most people think. For example, Jivestor is a company that offers trade
              copier for MT4 service as a white label. This means the service can be connected to any website without
              any branding displayed.</p>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">Let’s use an example here: James wants to become an entrepreneur. He knows
              trade copying has huge profit potential, so he sends an inquiry to Jivestor (or other white label
              platform). Then Jivestor team guides James through the whole process of setting this business up: from
              registering legal entity to setting up the DNS-records for his domain. In a matter of weeks, James has his
              own website that offers trade copying services. There is Jivestor trade copying software in the backend of
              his website, but the clients will never know about it. That’s it, James is a business owner. Next, he
              starts advertising his trade copying for MT4 and gets profit from every customer that signs up. Although
              it requires some effort at the beginning, a white label trade copier business can be handled by one person
              or two partners.</p>
          </li>

          <li class="blog-detail__row">
            <h3 class="blog-detail__row-label">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="blog-detail__text">Trade copying is a huge market, that keeps growing from year to year. It is
              very easy to find and join an MT4 trade copier, that’s why many investors rely on it to make constant
              profit. For people who understand how markets work and can profitably trade on their own, a remote trade
              copier offers an opportunity to increase income by sharing their strategy with others. People can make
              solid profit by simply using the service either as a signal provider or as a signal receiver, but there is
              a better way to profit from it. This way is to open an independent trade copying service. White label copy
              trading service provider Jivestor makes this process easy and convenient.</p>
